# üéØ Final Setup Steps - You're Almost Ready!

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- ‚úì BSC Testnet RPC is reachable
- ‚úì Polygon Amoy RPC is reachable
- ‚úì Dependencies installed
- ‚úì Contracts exist
- ‚úì Scripts are ready

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get a Private Key (2 minutes)

You need a wallet with a private key for deploying contracts.

**Option A: Create a new wallet (recommended for testing)**

```bash
# Use this Node.js script to generate a new wallet
node -e "const ethers = require('ethers'); const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom(); console.log('Address:', wallet.address); console.log('Private Key:', wallet.privateKey);"
```

**Option B: Export from MetaMask**

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the 3 dots ‚Üí Account Details
3. Click "Export Private Key"
4. Enter password
5. Copy the private key

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**:

- Use a TEST wallet only (not your main wallet)
- Never commit the `.env` file with real keys
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done)

### Step 2: Add Private Key to .env (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/nrahal/@code_2025/eth-layer2-lone/contracts

# Open .env in your editor
nano .env

# Replace this line:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here_without_0x_prefix

# With your actual key (remove 0x if present):
PRIVATE_KEY=abc123def456...

# Save: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X
```

### Step 3: Fund Your Wallet (5 minutes)

You need testnet tokens on both chains:

#### BSC Testnet (BNB)

- Faucet 1: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- Faucet 2: https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet
- Amount needed: ~0.1 BNB (for gas)

#### Polygon Amoy (MATIC)

- Faucet 1: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Faucet 2: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy
- Amount needed: ~0.5 MATIC (for gas)

**How to use faucets:**

1. Copy your wallet address (from Step 1)
2. Visit faucet website
3. Paste your address
4. Click "Send Me Test Tokens"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Verify Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/nrahal/@code_2025/eth-layer2-lone/contracts
./verify-setup.sh
```

You should see: ‚úì All checks passed!

### Step 5: Deploy Contracts (2 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy to both testnets
./deploy-multichain.sh
```

This will:

- Deploy to BSC Testnet
- Deploy to Polygon Amoy
- Save addresses to `deployed-addresses.json`
- Show you the deployment URLs

### Step 6: Update Multi-Chain Config (1 minute)

After deployment, copy the contract addresses to your sequencer config:

```bash
# The deployment script will show you the addresses
# Copy them to: /Users/nrahal/@code_2025/eth-layer2-lone/.env.multichain.example
```

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Generate or export private key
- [ ] Add private key to `contracts/.env`
- [ ] Get BSC testnet BNB from faucet
- [ ] Get Polygon Amoy MATIC from faucet
- [ ] Run `./verify-setup.sh` (should pass all checks)
- [ ] Run `./deploy-multichain.sh`
- [ ] Copy contract addresses to sequencer config
- [ ] Test the multi-chain settlement system

## üöÄ After Deployment

Once contracts are deployed, you can:

1. **Test the settlement router**:

```bash
cd ../sequencer
npm run example:multichain
```

2. **Verify contracts on block explorers**:

- BSC Testnet: https://testnet.bscscan.com/
- Polygon Amoy: https://www.oklink.com/amoy

3. **Start using multi-chain settlement**:

- Update your sequencer to use the router
- Watch it automatically choose the cheapest chain
- Save 80-95% on costs!

## üí° Tips

**If you see "insufficient funds":**

- Check balances: https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/YOUR_ADDRESS
- Get more from faucets (links above)

**If deployment fails:**

- Check your private key is correct (no 0x prefix)
- Ensure you have enough testnet tokens
- Try again (sometimes RPCs are slow)

**If you want to deploy to more chains:**

- Add network config to `hardhat.config.js`
- Add RPC URL to `.env`
- Update `deploy-multichain.sh`

## üéä You're Almost There!

Once you add your private key and fund it, you'll be ready to deploy the first multi-chain Layer 2 settlement system! üöÄ
