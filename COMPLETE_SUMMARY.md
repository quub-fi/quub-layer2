## 📈 Key Features

### Intelligent Routing

- ✅ Analyzes cost across all chains
- ✅ Considers speed and finality
- ✅ Monitors network congestion
- ✅ Selects optimal chain automatically

### Multiple Strategies

```typescript
// Cost-Optimized: Always choose cheapest
new CostOptimizedStrategy();

// Speed-Optimized: Always choose fastest
new SpeedOptimizedStrategy();

// Balanced: Best overall (RECOMMENDED)
new BalancedStrategy();
```

### Automatic Failover

```
Primary chain fails
    ↓
Router detects failure
    ↓
Automatically switches to next best chain
    ↓
Settlement succeeds
    ↓
No downtime!
```

### Real-Time Analytics

- Per-chain usage statistics
- Cost savings tracking
- Performance metrics
- Success rate monitoring
