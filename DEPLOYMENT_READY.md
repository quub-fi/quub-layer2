## 🎯 Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: Quick Test with Generated Wallet (Recommended for Testing)

**Generate a test wallet:**

```bash
cd contracts
node generate-wallet.js
```

This will:

- Create a new wallet with private key
- Show you the address
- Provide faucet links to get testnet tokens

**Then fund it:**

- BSC Testnet: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- Polygon Amoy: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

**Update your `.env`:**

```bash
# Copy the private key from generate-wallet.js output
# Edit contracts/.env and paste it
nano contracts/.env
# Update PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_GENERATED_KEY
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
cd contracts
./deploy-multichain.sh
```

### Option B: Use Your Existing Wallet

**If you have a funded testnet wallet:**

```bash
# Edit contracts/.env
nano contracts/.env
# Update PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_EXISTING_KEY
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
cd contracts
./deploy-multichain.sh
```

### Option C: Manual Deployment (Step by Step)

```bash
cd contracts

# 1. Deploy to BSC Testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet

# 2. Deploy to Polygon Amoy
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygonAmoy

# 3. Copy contract addresses to sequencer .env
```

## 📝 Before You Deploy - Checklist

## 🔧 Verification Commands

**Check your setup:**

```bash
cd contracts
./verify-setup.sh
```

**Test Hardhat:**

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

```

## 💰 Getting Testnet Tokens

### BSC Testnet BNB

1. Visit: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
2. Connect wallet or paste address
3. Request 0.1 BNB (enough for deployments)
4. Wait ~10 seconds

### Polygon Amoy MATIC

1. Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
2. Select "Polygon Amoy" network
3. Paste your address
4. Request tokens
5. Wait ~30 seconds

### Ethereum Sepolia ETH

1. Visit: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
2. Or: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
3. Request 0.5 ETH
4. Wait ~1 minute

## 🎊 Deployment Output

When you run `./deploy-multichain.sh`, you'll see:

```
🚀 Multi-Chain Deployment Starting...

📋 Pre-deployment checks...
✓ All checks passed

🌐 Deploying to BSC Testnet...
✓ Deployed OptimisticRollup: 0xABC...
✓ Deployed L1Bridge: 0xDEF...

🌐 Deploying to Polygon Amoy...

📝 Deployment Summary:
BSC Testnet:
  OptimisticRollup: 0xABC...
  L1Bridge: 0xDEF...

Polygon Amoy:
  OptimisticRollup: 0x123...
  L1Bridge: 0x456...

✅ Deployment complete!
```

## 📊 After Deployment

### 1. Update Sequencer Configuration

Copy contract addresses to `sequencer/.env`:

```bash
# Copy from contracts/.env or deployment output
BSC_SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT=0xABC...
BSC_BRIDGE_CONTRACT=0xDEF...
POLYGON_SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT=0x123...
POLYGON_BRIDGE_CONTRACT=0x456...
```

### 2. Test the Settlement Router

```bash
cd sequencer
npm run example:multichain
```

This will:

- Connect to all 3 chains
- Analyze settlement options
- Show cost comparison
- Display routing decisions

### 3. Verify on Block Explorers

**BSC Testnet:**

- https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xYOUR_CONTRACT

**Polygon Amoy:**

- https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0xYOUR_CONTRACT

**Ethereum Sepolia:**

- https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xYOUR_CONTRACT

### 4. Test End-to-End

```bash
# Run the full sequencer
cd sequencer
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Expected Costs

**Deployment Costs (per chain):**

- BSC Testnet: ~$0.10 USD (0.001 BNB)
- Polygon Amoy: ~$0.05 USD (0.05 MATIC)
- Ethereum Sepolia: ~$2-5 USD (0.002 ETH)

**Total to deploy on all 3 chains: ~$2-6 USD in testnet tokens**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"

```bash
# Get more testnet tokens from faucets
# BSC: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
# Polygon: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
```

### "Network not configured"

```bash
# Verify hardhat.config.js has the networks
# Check contracts/.env has RPC URLs
cat contracts/.env
```

### "Contract deployment failed"

```bash
# Check gas limits in hardhat.config.js
# Try deploying to one network at a time
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet
```

### "RPC unreachable"

```bash
# Test RPC connections
./verify-setup.sh

# Try alternative RPC URLs in .env
```

## 🎓 What Happens After Deployment

1. **Contracts are live** on BSC Testnet and Polygon Amoy
2. **Settlement router** can route to any of the 3 chains
3. **Automatic cost optimization** - routes to cheapest chain
4. **You can test** with real transactions on testnets
5. **Monitor savings** - track actual cost differences

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with BSC** - cheapest and fastest for testing
2. **Use balanced strategy** - best overall performance
3. **Monitor gas prices** - router will adapt automatically
4. **Test failover** - disconnect one chain and watch router switch
5. **Track metrics** - router provides detailed statistics

## 🎊 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ Contracts deployed on multiple chains
- ✅ Sequencer connects to all chains
- ✅ Batch analysis shows different costs per chain
- ✅ Router selects cheapest/fastest chain
- ✅ Settlement succeeds on selected chain
- ✅ Stats show cost savings vs Ethereum-only

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy?

**Final check:**

```bash
cd contracts
./verify-setup.sh
```

**If all green, deploy:**

```bash
./deploy-multichain.sh
```

**Or generate a test wallet first:**

```bash
node generate-wallet.js
# Fund the address
# Update .env with private key
./deploy-multichain.sh
```
