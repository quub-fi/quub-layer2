## 🔥 **Critical Path**

```
StateManager → Sequencer → Bridge → Tests → Testnet
    ↓            ↓           ↓        ↓        ↓
  2 days      3 days      3 days   2 days   1 day
```

**Total: 11 days to first working testnet deployment**

---

## 💰 **Resource Requirements**

### **Team Size**
- **Minimum**: 1 full-stack developer (4 months)
- **Optimal**: 2-3 developers (2 months)
- **Recommended**: 3 developers + 1 security expert (1.5 months)

### **Roles Needed**
1. **Smart Contract Developer** - Focus on L1 contracts
2. **Backend Developer** - Focus on sequencer/bridge/verifier
3. **DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure & deployment

### **Budget Estimate**
- Development: $50k-150k
- Security Audit: $50k-100k

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Technical KPIs**
- [ ] 100% test coverage on smart contracts
- [ ] <$0.01 per transaction on L2
- [ ] >1000 TPS (transactions per second)
- [ ] <2 second transaction confirmation
- [ ] 99.9% uptime

### **Business KPIs**
- [ ] $1M+ TVL in first month
- [ ] 1000+ daily active users
- [ ] 10+ DApps integrated

## ⚠️ **Risk Management**

### **High Risk Items**
1. **Smart Contract Bugs** → Mitigate with audit
2. **Sequencer Centralization** → Plan for decentralization
3. **L1 Gas Spikes** → Implement gas price optimization
4. **Low Adoption** → Partner with existing DApps

### **Contingency Plans**
- Keep 6 months runway in reserve
- Have bug bounty program ready
- Maintain emergency pause functionality
- Keep security firm on retainer

---
