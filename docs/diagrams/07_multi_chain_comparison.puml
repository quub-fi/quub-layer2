title Multi-Chain Settlement Comparison

package "Traditional Layer 2 (Locked to Ethereum)" {
  component "Your L2" as L2_OLD
  component "Ethereum" as ETH_OLD
  
  L2_OLD -down-> ETH_OLD : All settlements\n($50-200 per batch)
  
  note right of ETH_OLD
    ❌ High gas costs
    ❌ Network congestion
    ❌ Single point of failure
    ❌ No flexibility
  end note
}

package "Quub Multi-Chain Layer 2" {
  component "Your L2" as L2_NEW
  component "Settlement Router" as ROUTER
  
  L2_NEW -down-> ROUTER
  
  component "Ethereum" as ETH_NEW
  component "BSC" as BSC
  component "Polygon" as POLYGON
  component "Arbitrum" as ARB
  component "More..." as MORE
  
  ROUTER -down-> ETH_NEW : High security\n($20-100)
  ROUTER -down-> BSC : Low cost\n($2-5)
  ROUTER -down-> POLYGON : Fast finality\n($1-3)
  ROUTER -down-> ARB : Balanced\n($5-15)
  ROUTER -down-> MORE : Future chains
  
  note right of ROUTER
    ✅ Intelligent routing
    ✅ Cost optimization
    ✅ High availability
    ✅ User choice
    
    **Decision Factors:**
    • Gas prices
    • Chain congestion
    • Transaction type
    • User preferences
    • Security requirements
  end note
}

note bottom
  **Cost Comparison (100 tx batch):**
  Traditional: $50-200 (Ethereum only)
  Multi-Chain: $2-100 (depends on routing)
  Average Savings: **60-80%**
